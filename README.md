# Through

Through is a narrative-driven 2D-on-3D game where the player steps into the subconscious mind of a man in a coma following a traumatic car crash. The entire game world is a surreal, emotional landscape shaped by his memories, regrets, and unresolved trauma.
As players journey through dreamlike environments, they’ll explore key moments from the protagonist’s life—childhood struggles, relationship hardships, lost dreams, and deep-seated guilt. Each level represents a major emotional event, culminating in symbolic encounters or “bosses” that reflect the pain tied to those memories.
Unknown to the player at first, the world is not real—it's a manifestation of a fading mind clinging to meaning. Clues emerge gradually through sensory fragments from the real world (hospital sounds, voices of loved ones) embedded into the environment. The story builds toward a powerful choice: accept death and find peace, or fight to return to life.
The game blends emotional storytelling with light puzzle-solving and decision-making, aiming to leave players with a sense of catharsis and reflection.
